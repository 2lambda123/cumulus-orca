The ORCA recovery workflow diagram below visualizes the process of
recovering missing data in Cumulus. As each user organization will
have unique needs when recovering data, the diagram provides details
on which components can be modified and which components should not
be modified. Refer to the legend on the diagram for details on which
components can be modified.

Recovery processes are kicked off manually by an operator through
the Cumulus Dashboard. The dashboard calls an API which kicks off a
recovery workflow. Recovery is an asynchronous operation since data
requested from GLACIER can take up to 4 hours or more to reconstitute
in most scenarios, and DEEP_ARCHIVE can take 12 hours. 
Since it is asynchronous, the recovery container
relies on a database to maintain the status of the request and event
driven triggers to restore the data once it has been reconstituted
from archive into an S3 bucket. Currently data is copied back to the
Cumulus S3 primary data bucket as the final restore step. Determining
the status of the recovery job is done manually by querying the database
directly or by checking the status on the Cumulus Dashboard.

## Recovery workflow parameters

The following are the parameters needed for recovery workflow:

- buckets- AWS S3 bucket mapping used for Cumulus and ORCA configuration. Contains the following properties:
  - name (Required)- Name of the S3 bucket.
  - type (Optional)- the type of bucket - i.e. internal, public, private, protected. 

  It can be set up using the following configuration.
  ```json
        "config": {
          "buckets.$": "$.meta.buckets"
        }
    ```
    Example:

    ```json
    "buckets": {
            "protected": {"name": "sndbx-cumulus-protected", "type": "protected"},
            "internal": {"name": "sndbx-cumulus-internal", "type": "internal"},
            "private": {"name": "sndbx-cumulus-private", "type": "private"},
            "public": {"name": "sndbx-cumulus-public", "type": "public"}
        }
    ```
- fileBucketMaps- A list of dictionaries that contains details of the configured storage bucket and file regex. Contains the following properties:
  - regex (Required)- The regex that matches the file extension type.
  - bucket (Required))- The name of the key that points to the correct S3 bucket. Examples include public, private, protected, etc.
  - sampleFileName (Optional)- name of a sample file having extension.

  It can be set up using the following configuration.
  ```json
        "config": {
          "fileBucketMaps.$": "$.meta.collection.files"
        }
    ```
    Example: 
    ```json
        "fileBucketMaps":[
            {
            "regex":".*.h5$",
            "sampleFileName":"L0A_HR_RAW_product_0010-of-0420.h5",
            "bucket":"protected"
            },
            {
            "regex":".*.cmr.xml$",
            "sampleFileName":"L0A_HR_RAW_product_0010-of-0420.iso.xml",
            "bucket":"protected"
            }
    ```
- excludedFileExtensions (Optional)- A list of file extensions to ignore when copying files.
  It can be set up using the following configuration.
  ```json
        "config": {
          "excludedFileExtensions.$": "$.meta.collection.meta.orca.excludedFileExtensions"
        }
    ```
    Example: 
    ```json
        "excludedFileExtensions":[
            ".cmr",
            ".hdf
        ]
    ```
- defaultRecoveryTypeOverride (Optional)- Overrides the default restore type via a change in the collections configuration under `meta` tag as shown below. 
  ```json
  "meta": {
    "defaultRecoveryTypeOverride": "Standard"
  }
  ```
- defaultBucketOverride (Optional)- Overrides the default bucket to copy recovered files to.
  ```json
    "task_config": {
      "defaultBucketOverride": "{$.meta.collection.meta.orca.defaultBucketOverride}"
    }
    ```
- s3MultipartChunksizeMb (Optional)- Overrides default_multipart_chunksize from TF. Defaults to 250.
  ```json
    "task_config": {
      "s3MultipartChunksizeMb": "{$.meta.collection.meta.s3MultipartChunksizeMb}"
    }
    ```
- asyncOperationId (Optional)- The unique identifier used for tracking requests. If not present, it will be generated.
  ```json
    "task_config": {
      "asyncOperationId": "{$.cumulus_meta.asyncOperationId}"
    }
    ```
