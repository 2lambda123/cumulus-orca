ORCA relies heavily on Cumulus and integrates with Cumulus messaging,
functionality, and UI elements. The diagram below provides insight into how the
software systems interact along with the network and OU boundaries that are
crossed using the ORCA system. From a security standpoint, ORCA is generally not
interacted directly but instead is acted on by the existing Cumulus systems APIs
and Dashboard UI. Note that the actual archive storage for ORCA is maintained in
a separate account and VPC. This is done to better separate costs and
permissions related to this secondary archive copy.
