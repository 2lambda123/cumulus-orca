The ORCA software system is currently made up of two primary functions. The
first function is to archive a secondary copy of the data. This is done by
capitalizing on Cumulus Workflows. An end user would only need to add the proper
ORCA components to their ingest workflow in order to use the feature. The second
function is recovery of data from the secondary copy. Adding this functionality
is more involved but requires the user to add the proper components and
configuration to Cumulus to utilize. The diagram below gives a software system
view of ORCA and the various containers and protocols used within the system.
The following pages go into further details on each container.
